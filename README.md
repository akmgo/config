- **Zsh**  
  A highly customizable shell configured with useful aliases and plugin support to improve the command-line experience.

- **Fastfetch**  
  A system information tool used to display system details in a stylish format when opening a terminal, similar to Neofetch but faster and more customizable.

- **lla**  
  A modern replacement for `ls`, showing colorful and informative directory listings with icons and Git-aware sorting.

- **btop**  
  A resource monitor providing a visually rich and interactive overview of system performance, including CPU, memory, disk, and network usage, with mouse support and theming.

These configurations aim to streamline development workflows, enhance terminal aesthetics, and improve overall usability.
